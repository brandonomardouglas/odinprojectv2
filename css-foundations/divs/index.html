        <!--Here I am using a div id to 'section' a snippet of the website and then referencing it in style.css-->
        <div id="liststyle">
            <ol>
                <li>Div means divider, used to block styling of other elements</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This paragraph of text will be used within the div's style due to the div element</p>
        </div>

        <!-- This won't work as id's only work for one single element-->
        <div id="lifestyle">
            <p> This will not work as the lifestyle id was used previously on line 15.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Here we are combining the section-section css to many divs as classes can be used for many different elements.-->
        <div class="second-section">
            <p>Styling element 1</p>
        </div>

        <div class="second-section">
            <p>This will be the same style as line 29 due to the class attribute</p>
        </div>

        <p class="second-section">This should not be styled as in the stylesheet we specified second-section to be a div via div.section-section class so its only applicable to divs </p>
